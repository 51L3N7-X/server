Changelogs now work! {added marginTop}
======================

In the future, they'll be sent out like this, as well as in the default guild.
If you aren't in the default guild, you're missing out.
We talk mostly about Slowcord itself, and its the first place you'll find out about new features and bug fixes being worked on.
